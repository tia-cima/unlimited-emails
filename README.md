# unlimited-emails
Send unlimited emails to a recipient (ENG version)

This is the english version of the program "mail infinite"

This program offers 3 options:

create a Gmail account with random email and password

create a strong password choosing length and type

send unlimited emails to a recipient with a Gmail account

Like I said in the Italian version that's my first program ever written in python and posted on GitHub, so if you want to give me some tips about improving this script you can make me very happy and grateful, learning skills about people who knows this language is probably the best thing for a beginner like me, so thanks a lot if you do.
